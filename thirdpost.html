                        <p>While every U.S. citizen who is 18 or older has the right to vote, many elections take the majority votes within state districts and then compare those votes of the districts. Districts are geographic areas, and the number of districts depends on the state. Whichever district you live in is the district toward which your vote counts. Members of the House of Representatives, state legislatures, and many local offices are elected this way. Every ten years, these district lines are redrawn, but they can be manipulated in such a way that takes away the fairness in the election, often towards people of color. By federal law, redistricting has to happen to accommodate a near equal number of people in each district, which is supposed to make elections more fair. Gerrymandering is the process of drawing legislative lines to favor a political group in an election. </p>
                        <p>This hurts people of color because instead of keeping predominantly black communities together, these areas can be divided in order to make sure that people of color are in the minority of their district. This silences their voices and makes sure that white people get more of a say in the election results. For example, in Texas in 2003, the people who redrew district lines wanted to protect a Republican candidate who was not favored by Latinos. They moved about 100,000 latinos out of one district to dilute minority votes. In 2011, the federal court found that this was, in fact, intentional.</p>
                        <p>In my high school government class last year, we had a homework assignment to redistrict the state of Wisconsin to favor certain criteria listed while still following the laws for district division.With I was shocked by how for even high school students, it was easy to manipulate district lines in order to make sure one political party had more power than the other. What surprised me was that gerrymandering was not some elaborate scheme, but given the opportunity to redraw legislative lines, it is something that is easy to get away with. In order to make elections fair and to make sure every vote counts, state lines should be drawn to create a fair, competitive election. Amplifying minority voices does not have to silence others’.</p>
